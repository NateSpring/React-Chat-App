# React-Chat-App
This is a code challenge project that was presented to me from a small company. The task was to build a frontend for a React chat app using Hooks and functional components. The backend had been built already and used a local JSON file acting as a "message database". This was extremely fun because I learned the in's-n-out's of hooks and gained a deeper knowledge of functional components vs class-based components. 

To install, clone this repo then: 

1. To install dependenceies - npm install 
2. cd chat-app => npm run start
3. cd chat-backend => npm run start
4. Viola! You have a locally hosted React Chat App with hooks and functional components. Enjoy!
